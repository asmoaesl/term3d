# Term3D
A game engine for making 3D games in the terminal. The motivation was an odd way to play a 3D game; on a terminal screen.
Term3D does the rendering and input for you. It's a rather lightweight game engine, using fast algorithms for everything.

I'm working on this engine on a $150 laptop I bought at Walmart. I'm aiming for fast compilation, great performance, and one hell of a neat project for school and hobby.

# Examples
All code can be found in the 'examples' folder.
## Cube
A simple six-color cube primarily showcasing how a high-level implementation has changed the engine.
This was the original example, as before the engine was an *engine*, it was just a multi-colored cube made of text without an API.
